# Sentiment Analysis Project

This repository provides a modular pipeline for sentiment analysis using machine learning. Each Python module in the project is responsible for a specific part of the workflow:

- **data_loader.py**: Loads and processes data for machine learning tasks.
- **data_analyzer.py**: Analyzes data and generates insights.
- **data_preprocessing.py**: Contains functions for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **evaluation.py**: Evaluates the performance of machine learning models.
- **models.py**: Defines and manages machine learning model architectures.
- **pipeline.py**: Orchestrates the end-to-end machine learning pipeline.
- **train.py**: Handles model training routines.
- **try.py**: Allows experimentation with trained models.

Data files and trained models are stored in the `data/` directory.
